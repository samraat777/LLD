1 * (2 + 4)

here 1 and (2 + 4 ) can be two operands involved with the operator *
Similarly 2 and 4 are two operands with operator + 

We can see it is forming tree like structure, and we can think of composite design pattern 
as there will be operands that can further have operands inside and leaf node will be numbers.

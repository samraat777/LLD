Similar to abstract factory pattern if we have, different type of objects created by factory 1
then we need to create another factory on top of factory 1 to meet our needs

For Ex:
You have vehicles class and you have created abstract factory for it to get the objects whenever required based on some logic
Now you have an another requirement you need types of cars that are in luxary segment

IF WE HAVE A CHILD CLASSES INHERITING FROM PARENT CLASS CONTAINING COMMON FEATURES
->THEN WE HAVE CODE DUPLICACY
Example
Vehicle class{
drive(){
//Normal drive
}
}
Child
-> SportyVehicle extends Vehicle{
   drive(){
   //Speed Drive
   }
}

->PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle{
    drive(){
    //Inherit from parent - normal drive
    }
}

-> OffRoadVehicle extends Vehicle{
    drive()
    {
        //Speed drive
    }
}

We can see in few of the child class drive() method implementation is same


####Solution######
Vehicle class will have a drive strategy class that has child NormalDrive and SpeedDrive
There will be constructor injection in Vehicle class regarding which driveStrategy child will pick.
